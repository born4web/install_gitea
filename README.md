# Gitea server easy install 

Use these scripts to automate and ease of installation popular git server Gitea on Linux Ubuntu. 
Gitea can run on different kind of databases so choose the right script according your database demand.

Installation is as close as possible to official Gitea doccumentation recommendations (directory locations, permissions, ownerships,...).

For any installation script you will need bash_script_library.sh also, because it has some helpfull piece of code I use.

Thanks to https://linuxize.com/post/how-to-install-gitea-on-ubuntu-18-04/ for good working
manual for step by step installation process. I used those steps to build this scripts just 
because I am lazy to do it more then once manually.
